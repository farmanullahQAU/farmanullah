# Latest Updates - Portfolio Website

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Navigation Bar (Top Tabs) - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Navigation bar was not showing properly
**Solution**: Changed from `SliverAppBar` to `SliverToBoxAdapter` for better compatibility
- Navigation now visible and accessible
- Scroll-to-section functionality works perfectly

### 2. Profile Image on Home Page - ADDED ✅
**Feature**: Added a circular profile image placeholder on the home section
- Shows gradient circular border
- Appears on desktop only (responsive design)
- Positioned on the right side of the hero text
- Can be easily replaced with actual profile photo

**To add your actual photo**:
Replace the Icon with an Image.asset in `lib/widgets/home_section.dart`:
```dart
Image.asset('assets/images/profile.png')
```

### 3. Project Images in Portfolio - ENHANCED ✅
**Feature**: Now shows preview grid of max 3 images
- When project has multiple images, shows first 3 in a horizontal grid
- Click on any preview to open full carousel
- Dark themed gallery background for better contrast
- Responsive: 300px height on desktop, 250px on mobile
- All images still accessible in full carousel modal

**How it works**:
1. Portfolio section shows up to 3 image previews side-by-side
2. User clicks on the preview grid
3. Opens full-screen carousel with ALL images
4. Can swipe/zoom/navigate through all images

### 4. Performance Optimizations - IMPLEMENTED ✅
- Lazy loading of images
- Conditional rendering (only load what's needed)
- Efficient state management with GetX
- Smooth animations with curve interpolation
- Minimal rebuilds with proper widget keys
